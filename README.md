### Projects

This repo contains notebooks with two projects completed for the Udacity course "Programming for Data Science with R". 

### Description

#### "Explore BikeShare Data"

I came up with and answered three questions about three pre-cleaning data frames from the BikeShare database in R. Each answer includes at least one visualization (using the ggplot2 library) and a summary. 

#### "Investigate a Relational Database: The Sakila Movie Database"

I picked and answered four questions for investigating this database using SQL queries. Visualizations were made using Google Sheets and presented in pdf.
